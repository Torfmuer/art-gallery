This is a project by OWEN FOSTER built for his final project for MA-430 Graph Theory & Combinatorics.

The project is a simple greedy algorithm that takes in an edge-list format graph and returns a graph with each vertex colored.
Because it is a greedy algorithm, several of the examples shown are not optimal. 

I am currently (as of 11/17/23) working on an update to this algorithm. As a side project however, I don't have a ton of time to spare, as much more of my time is devoted to my current final projects. I will provide further documentation and updates soon.
